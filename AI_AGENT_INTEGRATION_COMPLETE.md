- **Assessment Agent**: Generates adaptive assessments based on user skill level  
- **Wellness Agent**: Monitors learning wellness and provides balance recommendations
- **Schedule Agent**: Creates optimized study schedules with wellness integration
- **Motivation Agent**: Provides personalized motivation and encouragement
- **Personalization Agent**: Adapts learning paths based on user preferences and performance

### Key Features

#### 🎯 Complete Learning Journey Generation
- **Orchestrated AI Response**: All agents work together to create comprehensive learning experiences
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Videos, articles, exercises, and interactive content
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Assessments and content adjust to user performance
- **Wellness Integration**: Learning schedules consider stress levels and energy

#### 🔄 Agent Coordination
- **Sequential Processing**: Agents process information in logical order
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks run simultaneously for efficiency
- **Context Sharing**: Agents share insights to provide cohesive recommendations
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling ensures system reliability

## 🎮 Using the AI Agent System

### 1. Complete Learning Journey
Navigate to `/ai-agents` and try the "Complete Learning Journey" feature:
- Enter a skill (e.g., "React.js", "Python", "Machine Learning")
- The system orchestrates all agents to create a comprehensive learning plan
- Receive personalized resources, assessments, wellness recommendations, and motivation

### 2. Individual Agent Functions
Test each agent individually:
- **Smart Resources**: Get curated learning materials
- **Adaptive Assessment**: Generate personalized quizzes
- **Wellness Check**: Monitor learning balance
- **Motivation Boost**: Get encouragement and tips

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Enhanced Orchestrated Endpoints
```javascript
// Generate complete learning journey
POST /api/ai-agents/generate-complete-journey
{
  "target_skill": "React.js",
  "user_profile": {
    "experience_level": "beginner",
    "learning_style": "visual",
    "time_availability": "2-3 hours/day"
  }
}

// Get smart learning resources
POST /api/ai-agents/smart-resources
{
  "topic": "JavaScript Async/Await",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
}

// Generate adaptive assessment
POST /api/ai-agents/adaptive-assessment
{
  "skill_area": "Python Basics",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "question_count": 5
}

// Wellness check
GET /api/ai-agents/wellness-check

// Motivation boost
POST /api/ai-agents/motivation-boost
{
  "context": "struggling_with_concepts"
}
```

## 🔧 Integration Details

### Agent Coordination Flow
1. **Input Analysis**: Master orchestrator analyzes user request using AI
2. **Agent Selection**: Determines which agents to invoke based on requirements
3. **Execution Planning**: Creates execution plan (sequential vs parallel)
4. **Agent Coordination**: Executes agents and manages context sharing
5. **Response Synthesis**: Combines agent outputs into cohesive response

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- **Graceful Degradation**: If one agent fails, others continue
- **Fallback Responses**: Default content when AI services are unavailable
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries for transient failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Frequently requested content cached for speed
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent agents run concurrently
- **Response Streaming**: Large responses streamed for better UX
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls managed to respect service limits

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Start the Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Complete Journey
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/ai-agents`
2. Enter "React.js" in the Complete Learning Journey section
3. Watch as all agents coordinate to create a comprehensive response

### 3. Test Individual Agents
- Try each agent function individually
- Observe how they provide specialized responses
- Check the session summary to see accumulated data

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics
